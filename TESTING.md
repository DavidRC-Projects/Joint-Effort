#### Identified Issues on Lighthouse and Fixes

No bug fixes were required for the homepage after performing Lighthouse checks on both desktop and mobile views.

For the 404 error page (desktop), the accessibility rating was initially reduced due to the use of a meta refresh, and the SEO rating was affected by missing meta tags. After removing the meta refresh and adding appropriate meta tags, both the accessibility and SEO scores improved to 100.

For the 404 error page (mobile), the performance score was initially lower due to the size of the background image. I used an image resizer to reduce the image size by half, which improved the performance score to 89, which is a reasonable result without losing quality of the image.
