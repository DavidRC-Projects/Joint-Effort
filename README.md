### Typography

I have used google fonts to import all fonts on the site.

The Merriweather font was used as the primary font, with Poppins as the secondary font. Both are sans-serif fonts that improve readability and gives an academic feel.

### Wireframes

I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop using figma.
